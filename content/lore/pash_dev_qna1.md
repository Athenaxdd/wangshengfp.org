title: 'Q&A with the Developers of Genshin Impact, May 2021'
---

#### **Q1: This project has been steadily gaining players and fans since its launch last year. How do you feel about the player reception towards the game?**

**A1:** We are very glad that Genshin Impact is receiving attention from so many players. But at the same time, as the number of Travelers enjoying the world of Teyvat continues to increase, it places a greater pressure on us, since it’s our responsibility to make this game an enjoyable experience for all Travelers. So we will continue to work hard towards generating content that satisfies everyone.

#### **Q2: The development of an open-world setting sounds really difficult. What is it like in the field, working in the company where the development is happening?**

**A2:** It’s really busy every single day, but things are going smoothly and according to schedule. 

#### **Q3: Can you tell us about the inspiration behind this work and how the worldview was constructed?**

**A3:** We decided to establish the “Genshin” project towards the end of January 2017. At that time, the majority of our company’s development work had been put into the already-released “Honkai Impact 3”, and the plan for the coming years was to produce a continuation of “Honkai Impact 3” that would make leaps and bounds in terms of quality. We believed that “Honkai 3”, as Mihoyo’s first ever 3D game, was a great step forward compared to the previous “Honkai Academy '', which was only a two-dimensional game. However, since [the release of] “Honkai 3”, our producers had been rather at a loss as to what to do next. 

The [moment of] inspiration that let us reach a firm decision came in April 2017 with the release of  version 1.4 for “Honkai Impact 3”. 1.4 was a very exciting version for our team, and the most impactful part would have to have been the release of “Yae Village” as an open world feature. In the beginning, this feature was only to try out [the process], and it was very different from the ideal “open world” we were aiming for, but the process of development helped us to find a clear goal to let players experience an “ideal open world”. Rather than learning new playstyles and skills, our mission is to provide a better and more casual gaming experience, and this [mission] became our starting point for making “Genshin Impact”. 

To construct the world view of “Genshin Impact”, we initially decided it would inherit certain settings from our previous works. Mihoyo’s games always maintain the central theme of “fighting against the end, and saving the world”, and Genshin Impact inherits this theme as well. In building Genshin’s worldview and the foundations of the story, we referred to literature on various systems of myths and legends, and eventually decided on “Gnosticism” as Genshin’s foundation. In Gnostic legends, there is significant discussion around the theme of “the relationship between humans and the world”, and this corresponds with the idea of “the interactions between players and the in-game world” that our game would like to present through its open-world format. We therefore chose it as the core of the [game’s] worldview and the foundation of its storyline. In Gnosticism, there is also the existence of lower-ranked gods called “Archons”; these are also referred to as “holders of mortal power”, representing great power in the mortal world. They command the power of the elements and guide the people in building their cities and civilisations, and references to these aspects gave more details to the setting of the Genshin world.

#### **Q4: Which part of the development process brought you the most joy, and which the most pain?**

**A4:** The part that brings the most joy is the chance to work with fellow game enthusiasts in creating an interesting and realistic world, as well as characters. The worst part is… quite a lot of things. For example, pre-release, there were issues such as how we could make the open-world gameplay interesting, and we also had to repeatedly polish and reexamine the mechanisms of elemental reactions. Since release, the most troubling part has probably been deciding on what new content to provide to players in the next version. There are so many things, I can’t list all the examples (laughs). In spite of this, our development team has a “happiness-kept” principle, which is that the more painful the development process was, the greater the joy the end result would bring to players and to ourselves in the end. [Therefore,] the greater the players’ enjoyment of the game, the greater the difficulties and issues the developers must have overcome. Our pain is closely tied to a feeling of joy, and it is with this understanding that our team devotes itself to the game’s development each day.

#### **Q5: What is the character design process like? What is the most difficult part of designing a character?**

**A5:** Designing a character is a very complicated process. In the initial stages, members of the Art, IP (those in charge of the plot and worldview), and Development teams frequently exchange opinions and fine-tune their ideas. After deciding on the character’s basic details, the production process starts, beginning with a long period of continuous adjustments of artwork drafts. Basically, [this process] requires constant communication and discussion between the relevant personnel over a long period of time. The hardest part [of this process] is how to express these thoughts and ideas in the gameplay. For example, Genshin’s official website has an introduction to the Liyue character ‘Xiao’ and his style of combat. One of his skills was intended to reflect his life as an adeptus, as well as unique aspects of Liyue’s culture. Expressing details like these through [the design of] the characters is the hardest part to achieve. 

#### **Q6: Among the currently released characters, whose design was the most troublesome?**

**A6:** Tartaglia. His hometown “Snezhnaya” is still an unreleased region, so he alone must be able to express the combat style, culture and customs of his hometown. To give him a design that is charismatic and likeable, and also to show the impact of his past on him (the details of this part has been omitted as it contains spoilers), we decided he would have the ability to do a “stance change” in combat. Through this, we hoped to show his battle-hungry personality, as well as a side of him exploring new styles of combat from those he previously knew. Tartaglia was a very challenging character to design, both from an artistic perspective, and taking into account his [unique] combat mode. He was a difficult character from the designing stage all the way to the production stage.

#### **Q7: Out of the currently released regions, which ones had the most effort devoted to its development?**

**A7:** My personal favourites are “Stormterror’s Lair” and “Dragonspine”. “Stormterror’s Lair” is a region that merges both backstory and elements of exploration. This, along with dark, melancholic background music, gives [the player] a strong immersive experience. “Dragonspine” was a region that we put a lot of effort into, as we were striving to give Travelers an entirely different exploration experience from what they had experienced before. Since the region itself wasn’t that big in terms of map area, we created a lot of space on the inside, and the addition of volume and dimensionality to the map was a lot of additional work for us. That being said, it was our wish for it to be a special, unique experience for Travelers. 

#### **Q8: Are the banner names for each event rate-up character an extension of the impression that character gives?**

**A8:** Yes, the banner name for each character is decided based on the character’s traits and appearance. For example, Venti’s banner, “Ballad in Goblets”, was inspired by his carefree and outgoing personality and his love for alcohol, as well as his identity as a wandering bard with a love for freedom. For Venti, beautiful ballads and a goblet full of good wine are both things he loves and enjoys, so “Ballad in Goblets” was used as a banner name that expresses this. Other character banner names are also decided based on a careful selection of words and phrases that suit their personality.

#### **Q9: How are the combat styles designed and produced?**

**A9:** [A character’s] combat style is carefully designed based on that particular character. First, we collect details on the character’s appearance, personality, life experiences, personal experiences, etc, and combine these aspects together, producing a large selection of animation drafts. Among these drafts, those approved by the entire production team are then selected and polished. Throughout the production process, the plot and the game mechanism may still be adjusted or changed. When this happens, we sometimes need to correct and adjust combat styles that were already in the works, causing the process to take even longer.

#### **Q10: How were the designs and themes of the Artifacts decided on?**

**A10:** For the design of the artifacts, our inspiration comes from “Tarot cards” and “William Blake’s poetry”. First, in Tarot, there is a card named “The Magician” who commands four objects representing the four [classical] elements: the “Chalice of Water”, the “Coin of Earth”, the “Wand of Fire”, and the “Sword of Wind”. Secondly, in William Blake’s famous poem, “Auguries of Innocence”, the symbols of sand, flower, and robin’s plume were used, representing “Infinity”, “Eternity” and “Judgement”, respectively. If I keep going along this line, we will be touching upon the core of the story, so it might be hard for me to go into further details... But basically, the two [sources] previously mentioned were the inspirations for artifacts, and so we decided on “Flower of Life”, “Plume of Death”, “Sands of Time”, “Goblet of Space”, and “Circlet of Reason/Logic” as the main themes of the artifacts.

Just a bit more: in the plot’s setting, you can’t just equip artifacts and immediately gain their effects. Instead, before you depart on your journey, there needs to be a prayer ceremony in order for you to receive their blessings and protections. This is also the reason why the characters appear to be in a pose that looks like prayer in the artifact equipment screen. 

#### **Q11: Why the insistence on including cats and dogs in the streets, and what are some inspirations for how they move and act?**

**A11:** Our inspiration to include various animals in the map comes from our insistence on making Teyvat a world with a realistic ecosystem. So, when designing animals in the game, we place an emphasis on “realism”. Various elements, including agile movements and the cute behavior and sounds they make, were combined to bring out this “realism”. The more similarity Travelers can feel between Teyvat and the real world, the more immersion they will experience, and it is with these thoughts that we polished these details.

#### **Q12: Please recommend a good photo spot in the game.**

**A12:** Travelers should go exploring and look for one themselves!

#### **Q13: Any last words for the Travelers and fans?**

**A13:** My sincerest gratitude to the Travelers adventuring in Teyvat for all their love and support for “Genshin Impact”! Please continue supporting Genshin in the future as well!
