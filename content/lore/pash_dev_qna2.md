title: 'Q&A with the Developers of Genshin Impact, October 2021'
---

#### **Q1: We are finally celebrating the first anniversary of Genshin Impact! How are you all feeling right now?**

**A1:** Actually… As a developer, this past year has felt unreal (laughs). The development team has felt like runners constantly sprinting at full speed the entire race. The work put into each patch has been stressful yet fulfilling; we really don’t have much energy left to look back on the past.
But when I take the time to calm down and reflect on the past year, I feel like a child who has suddenly grown up overnight, and the feeling is incredible. As a Chinese game developer, we feel honored to have received such widespread praise and support from both the Chinese and international player base… We will do our best to hold on to this motivation and keep working towards generating content that players all over the world can enjoy.

#### **Q2: How do you feel looking back on this past year?**

**A2:** If I were to sum this year up in one word, it would be “evolutionary”.
“Genshin Impact” is continuously evolving in terms of the scale and playability of its content. When the game was first released, version events were pushed out slowly, and the game experience wasn’t quite ideal. Six months later, however, players have been able to experience a wide range of new features, such as the Serenitea Pot, the Golden Apple Archipelago, and Waverider boats. 

In Version 2.1, in addition to having more regions in Inazuma available to explore, [Travelers] can also go fishing at various spots throughout Teyvat. The game was able to ‘evolve’ like this not only because of the growth in our team’s technical abilities, but also thanks to the many suggestions and critique continuously received from the players. These [comments] allow us to both improve on our own ideas and place ourselves in the players’ shoes, in order to bring about new experiences and new forms of gameplay. 

In this way, we have been constantly working on ways to ‘evolve’ the players’ gaming experience. In addition to this, “Genshin Impact” also aims to surpass the framework of our existing content, providing content that soars far above player expectations. We will make sure to keep this mission in mind in future maintenance of the game as well.

#### **Q3: Could you share some behind-the-scenes stories on the development of Version 1.6’s limited-time region “Golden Apple Archipelago”?**

**A3:** That [development] process [for the Golden Apple Archipelago] actually proved to be a rather difficult one. The first major challenge [we faced] was deciding how to utilise a limited set of existing resources to create a sufficient amount of fun content [for the players]. At the time, most of our staff was busy working on Inazuma, so the design team [for the 1.6 update] needed to conserve its resources. Therefore, we decided to create islands, in order to bring out a feeling of “summer”. Our next challenge was how to create a sense of exploration within this open space. After many rounds of deliberation, we finally decided on two main elements, “fog” and “a series of mountain ranges”, in order to bring out a feeling of exploration and progression.

Additionally, the movements of the Waverider boat were also rather difficult to manage. Since this was a new and three-dimensional experience, [the Waverider’s] development required a carefully balanced combination of realistic movement and enjoyable maneuvering, and this took us quite a lot of effort to achieve. In terms of the storyline, we hoped to combine “exploration” with “emotions'' to create a stronger sense of immersion. Does everyone still remember the little rock in the far corner of the archipelago that made a heart shape when the sun shined through the gap in the rocks?

#### **Q4: What were the initial design principles or concepts considered when designing the map of Inazuma?**

**A4:** In the initial stages of development, we had two main points we wanted to follow. First, we wanted to incorporate the Electro element into the exploration itself, working it into the local biodiversity and geography to enhance the immersiveness of the map. Second, each island was to have a clear theme and ‘personality’ in terms of settings, plot, and game mechanics. At the same time, we also came up with several cool mechanisms to aid in exploration. For example, the Amakumo Peak at Seirai Island started off with the initial concepts of “thunder”, “broken”, “static” and “chunks of rock afloat in the sky”.

#### **Q5: What was your biggest takeaway from the development of Inazuma?**

**A5:** Adapting [the region] to support various gameplay platforms. Mondstadt and Liyue were both very big regions, but in the early stages [of Genshin Impact’s development,] our teams were rather lacking in experience, so the overall exploration density of these regions was not so high. Conversely, Inazuma is an archipelago with a limited land area, yet the complexity of gameplay [encountered] within this restricted area needed to be increased [compared to previous regions]. Because of this, the [Inazuma] region contained much more playable content, but also placed a significantly increased load imposed on the player’s device. 

This may not affect PC and console players, but can prove to be destructive for players on mobile devices. Many [mobile players] may end up experiencing the game crashing or freezing [from this load], greatly impacting their gameplay experience. 

Hence, despite having already finished the initial content for Inazuma, we ended up spending a lot of time on iterations [focused on] the improvement of Inazuma’s gameplay mechanics, as well as the presentation of the in-game scenery. For high-risk regions, we even made a system to optimize performance. 
[Thanks to this,] before the release of the new version, we finally managed to create smooth gameplay on all platforms. Most importantly, this process allowed us to gain valuable experience in design and optimisation, and made the development of future content slightly easier. 

#### **Q6: Please share with us the story behind the Raiden Shogun’s design.**

**A6:** The mention of Inazuma inevitably leads us back to the Raiden Shogun (laughs). This character is involved in a detailed series of storytelling, character, and boss fight designs. Naturally, there’s a lot of details I would love to share.

In the two fights we had against the Raiden Shogun, she wielded the ability to deprive you of the power of “Visions”, making it so that all characters apart from the Traveler were unable to use their Elemental Skills and Bursts. We thought that this was a great way to create a sense of oppression and despair in an increasingly grim battle, and this corresponds to the immense power that she holds as one of the seven Archons.

And then, once the Traveler hears and collects the wishes of everyone, this lock on the skills is removed. No matter how many times the Traveler falls in the final battle, they can stand up once again through the support from everyone. 

Both of these battles were carefully designed to match with the progression of the story. This, combined with the music created by HOYO-MIX, sought to present a battle of overwhelming scale, as well as invoke a strong sense of purpose.

In terms of character design, the Raiden Shogun is someone who carries the dreams of [her] people with her. With this as the basis, the concepts of “wishes” and “Visions” were adapted into the “Elemental Skill” and “Elemental Burst” seen in her playable mode. The Raiden Shogun can provide additional damage to her teammates’ Elemental Bursts, which then allow her to gain stacks of “Resolve”. These stacks of Resolve can then increase the damage of Raiden’s own Elemental Burst, through which she returns elemental energy to her team… This design of her and her teammates supplementing each other opens the door for new ideas in team building, such as a party focused on Elemental Bursts and energy recovery. It also represents the way that she is a carrier of her people’s wishes, and emphasizes her determination to shoulder these responsibilities in her path going forward. 

The Raiden Shogun is the character that we have spent the longest time designing so far, as well as the character that has gone through the greatest amount of changes and adjustments. Her boss fight and playable character, as well as her story, were the result of a combined effort from multiple teams. Rather than design or technical issues, the greatest challenge was to ensure that everyone in such a big team was of the same mind and working towards the same goals. We were glad to experience such a challenging and fulfilling process, and we hope that players like her design as well.

#### **Q7 What were some problems you encountered in designing the various islands in Inazuma?**

**A7:**

##### **Seirai Island**
> The Asase Shrine on Seirai Island was a unique place that was quiet, peaceful, and filled with cats, so the developers were all very excited about it. When we tested the quest series and got to the moment where the cat-shaped cloud appeared, everyone clapped. It was delightful to see what we had created expressed in such a way.

##### **Yashiori Island**
> NPC-related missions, such as those involving Chouji and Yasumoto, were intentionally designed to be presented in the form of fragmented narratives. Due to the use of fragmented sentences and the injection of large amounts of story information into these quests, we were initially worried that the players may not be able to make sense of the story in its entirety. However, it appears that many players enjoyed the story of Yashiori Island. 

##### **Narukami Island**
> The biggest challenge here was of course the world quest, “Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual”. Due to the complicated nature of these missions, there was an unexpectedly huge amount of bugs, and the team was constantly worried that they might not be able to fix things in time for the version update. Even on the day before the update, the whole team was still working overtime to fix this quest.

##### **Tatarasuna**
> Tatarasuna was a complex region with several levitating parts. Our team put a lot of effort in to ensure that this design did not impact the player’s experience, and that they were able to move smoothly around the region. This optimization took us many tries and rounds of adjustment [to get right].

#### **Q8: Inazuma has many puzzles that were not seen in Mondstadt or Liyue, and are way more difficult. How did this come about?**

**A8:** We thought that the puzzles in Mondstadt and Liyue were too boring and monotonous, with one example being just needing to light three torches. So when we were making Inazuma, we thought about how we could integrate the fun of solving puzzles into the [game’s] worldview, such as tying the puzzles into stories, and linking [the puzzles to] the use of the Electro element. Of course, there were some puzzles that were independent of the stories and quests as well. We actually lowered their difficulty quite a few times, but these [puzzles] still seem to prove rather challenging for the players. Personally though, I think that raising the difficulty of the puzzles is beneficial towards encouraging communication and cooperation among players, and makes for a good topic of conversation and discussion as well. I checked in on various gaming communities after the version update and it does look pretty effective; there are even players who got to make new friends thanks to these puzzles.

#### **Q9: Is there anything about Inazuma that you would like to bring the players’ attention to?**

**A9:** We have always encouraged the players to uncover the secrets of each region [themselves]. Inazuma has its own rich history shrouded in mystery. Just like in Dragonspine and Jueyun Karst, these pieces of history are silently waiting to be uncovered in the form of missions, readable documents, and stone slates. At the same time, the Raiden Shogun’s Character PV also hinted at the players being able to find out what happened to both [Raiden’s] old friends and herself. After exploring Inazuma to the fullest, players will be able to gain a deeper understanding of this land, the “Eternity” the Electro Archon seeks to protect, as well as the past and future of Teyvat.

#### **Q10: What does the journey to Inazuma mean to the Traveler?**

**A10:** Inazuma is a vastly different nation from the likes of Monstadt or Liyue. It is a nation where its people continue to cling onto their hopes and dreams, despite being hurt and taken down a diverging path. The Raiden Shogun herself also had a period where she lost her direction, yet in the end, she too chose to press forward, shouldering her people’s hopes and dreams with her. We hope that these stories allow the Traveler to think of the relationship between Teyvat, its Gods, and its people. Like the Traveler, we hope that after their experiences in Inazuma, players will also be able to find a clearer answer as to why they have embarked on this journey.

#### **Q11: Have you considered doing reruns of certain events?**

**A11:** Events that have received positive feedback from players will be improved on and appear again in the future. As for the storyline, we won’t slack off on this as well, and will continue to create stories that allow for the characters [of Genshin Impact] to shine.

#### **Q12: What are your expectations for the upcoming year?**
A12: First of all, I wish I could be less busy (laughs). Just kidding… My personal hope is to not fall out of step with time, to not to be limited by my age or experience, and to be able to enjoy the same game, behold the same scenery, and delight in the same pleasant surprises as the players. In the coming year, I will continue to come up with interesting ideas that the team and myself can work together on and bring to fruition, and receive the players’ support and affirmation. I think this alone [would be] the happiest thing already, so I won’t ask for anything more (laughs).

#### **Q13 Any final words for the Travelers?**
**A13:** Thank you for all your continuous support, and I hope you’ve enjoyed “Genshin Impact” over this past year. In the year to come, “Genshin Impact” is going to get even more exciting; so please look forward to it!
