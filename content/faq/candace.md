## Character Overview
*Authored by Dylan*

![](/faq/candace/Candace.png)

Candace is a Hydro polearm-user who is most comfortable being played as a support. She is the only character at the time of writing who offers a Hydro infusion to melee weapons. Aside from this, she is a character who scales entirely with HP, much like Nilou, unless you’re committing to auto-attacks (which is not recommended). 

Using Candace’s burst off cooldown is essential, so you must have 220% Energy Recharge as a solo Hydro (no Favonius Lance), and 200% if you are using Favonius Lance. If you are using Favonius Lance with another Hydro character, Candace’s energy requirements are lowered to 180%.

Candace cares about Energy Recharge, Crit Rate (at least 30%), HP, Crit Damage,  and sometimes ATK (if on-field DPS) or Elemental Mastery (if built for transformative reactions). As far as weapons go, you can pick any weapon that has Crit, HP, or Energy Recharge, since all of her talents scale off of HP (excluding auto-attacks).

Candace’s constellations focus on improving her personal damage, increasing application, and extending Hydro infusion.Candace’s C1 extends the duration of her Hydro infusion, C2 will increase her max HP by 20% when her Elemental Skill hits an enemy. Her C6 gives her extra Hydro application and where most of her personal damage comes from, assuming she isn’t the one on field. 


## Talents
*Authored by Athena*

![](/faq/candace/talents.png)

**Leveling priority: Burst > Skill > Normal Attack**

### Analysis:

Candace’s kit mainly involves around her Burst to enable her Hydro infusion, and since she scales almost entirely of HP aside from Normal Attacks, leveling her to 90 is recommended to max out her base HP. Keep in mind that her damage contribution is not the greatest, therefore investing in other important units is advisable here. 

Her Normal Attacks do not deal a great amount of damage, and it is also the only part of her kit to scale off ATK instead of HP, thus diverting her build (except for on-field Candace enthusiast, then level her Normal Attack first). 

Candace’s skill has two options, tap and hold. Both scale with max HP. On tap, she rushes forward and deals Hydro damage, while holding her skill blocks the incoming damage with a shield that scales off her HP, has a longer cooldown but deals more damage. While holding can inflict more damage, it is not recommended since it takes a long time to cast , and the damage difference is not worth the time. After Ascension 1, when you get hit while shielding, her skill will finish instantly (similar to Yun Jin’s skill) but still has the same cooldown as when holding. With her fourth Constellation, her hold cooldown is reduced to be the same as her tap cooldown, which allows for more hold skill use if get the right timing. 

Candace’s burst is her biggest selling point. Being the first character that provides Hydro infusion, she enables driver options for freeze, vaporize and bloom teams among others. Her Burst, combined with her Ascension 4 passive, will buff Elemental Normal Attacks hence also buff the on-field driver. When swapping between characters, it creates Wave Impact DMG instances that scales off HP, which is her main source of damage when playing as a support. 

Finally, her overworld passive talent is great for exploring with the 20% climbing stamina reduction. 


## ER Requirement
*Authored by Athena*

In general, Candace needs around 220% Energy Recharge (ER%) **with** Favonius Lance to burst every rotation as a solo Hydro unit due to her Skill’s particle generation being lackluster for her 60-cost Burst, as well as she will most likely be off-field after using her Burst, making funneling energy particles difficult. Each favonius weapon passive proc will reduce her Energy Recharge requirement by 15% to 20%. In situations where her teFm comp has another Hydro unit, her Energy Recharge requirement is significantly reduced to 180% **with** Favonius Lance. As always, an Energy Recharge Calculator is recommended to figure out how much ER% Candace needs in certain team comps.

## Weapons
*Authored by Attila the Pun*

Weapon ranking:
**Favonius Lance** if available

**R5 Kitain Cross Spear** if billets are available 

Any ER weapon, **Black/White Tassel**

Candace follows the general trend among recent 60 cost units that dictates that they need more ER than 80 cost units, and she follows this quite well. Despite having 2 / 3 particle gen on her burst, she often requires 230+ ER *and* Favonius Lance if no other Hydro units are present to alleviate her needs unless you make room in your rotation to swap back to let her E a second time. This seriously impacts her weapon choices outside of double Hydro team setups, and any weapon that does not help her with this issue is a non-starter there

Favonius Lance is the obvious best choice here with a 30.6% ER substat plus a passive that is often worth another 40-50% on a unit as energy starved as she is.
Engulfing Lightning is technically better with an 85.1% ER stat, but unless your team has all their energy needs already met, the extra energy given off Favonius’s passive will likely be more relevant than whatever you’d gain.

After this, there’s 2 different 45.9% ER sub weapons to choose from: The Catch and Prototype Starglitter. While The Catch techincally *does* do more damage, it’s also generally wasted on her, so Prototype Starglitter will do.

The last ER weapon of note is the Kitain Cross Spear. Depending on team and rotation, its passive can be worth anywhere from 30-60 ER. In most solo Hydro comps with no additional help, a R5 Kitain Cross Spear is on par with generic ER sub weapons, pushing her ER by a multiplicative 25-33%. However, with an Exile set in the mix, this number gets pushed to a multiplicative 30-40%, enough to potentially get close to even Favonius while being 100% craftable. This weapon also shines in Fridge team where you want to stack EM on her.

However, in double Hydro setups, her ER needs fall to a somewhat more manageable 180% with either Favonius, or making room for a 2nd E. At this point, ER is still an issue, but no longer crippling to her entire kit. Feel free to use more damaging weapons if you feel the need to, but her damage by and large does not matter, so Favonius remains king.

## Artifact

### Artifact Main Stats

Candace has two build options: On-field and Off-field. Depending on what purpose you choose, her builds will change in order to fit the corresponding playstyle.

**Off-field:**

**Sands of Eon: HP% or ER%**

ER% sand is always recommended to easily reach ER requirement. For situations where her ER requirement is lower, HP% sand can be considered to further buff the on-field character. 

**Goblet of Eonothem: Hydro DMG% or HP%**

Hydro DMG% let Candace deal more damage while HP% one boost the driver’s

**Circlet of Logos: CRIT or HP%**

Same as Goblet, CRIT for more personal damage and HP% to enhance on-field driver Normal Attacks damage.

> Substats priority: ER% (until meet requirement) > CR > CD > HP% = EM


**On-field Hydro DPS build:**

**Sands of Eon: ATK% or ER%**

ER% sand is always recommended to easily reach ER requirement. For situations where her ER requirement is lower, ATK% will increase her Normal Attack damage. 

**Goblet of Eonothem: Hydro DMG%**

Hydro DMG% let Candace deal more damage through her Normal Attacks

**Circlet of Logos: CRIT**

Same as Goblet, CRIT let her dish out more damage overall.

Substats priority: ER% (until meet requirement) > CR = CD > ATK% > HP% > EM
### Artifact substats
**On-field**

![](/faq/candace/arti1.png)

For on-field Hydro DPS Candace, her artifacts choices are quite flexible. Usually you would aim for **4pc Heart of Depths** or **4pc Gladiator’s Finale**, but a combination of **2pc ATK%** (*Gladiator’s Finale*, *Shimenawa’s Reminiscence* ,...), **2pc Tenacity of the Milleliths**, **2pc Heart of Depths**, **2pc Emblem of Severed Fate** with better substats than the 4pc options above should also perform very similarly. 

**Off-field**

Off-field Burst DPS

![](/faq/candace/arti2.png)

For off-field Burst DPS, Candace has two main choices: 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate (EoSF) and 4pc Noblesse Oblige (NO). For 4pc EoSF, combining with an ER% weapon can increase her burst and C6 damage; while 4pc NO is generally used for buffing other teammates. The other 2pc options can be viable with good substats, but in most cases it is not recommended.

Off-field support

![](/faq/candace/arti3.png)

For off-field support, Candace has two main choices: **4pc Noblesse Oblige** (NO) and **4pc Instructor** to buff teammates after using burst. Using 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate or combining 2pc sets can achieve higher damage, however it lacks the utility provided by the two mentioned above. In certain 15-second rotation, **4pc Exile** can also be worth using to lessen other characters’ Energy Recharge, making it useful to invest the substats leaning more toward damage (Note that in **4pc Instructor** and **4pc Exile** case, a 5 stars ER Sands is **very** recommended for more Energy Recharge on Candace to meet her Energy Recharge requirement).

You can also consider **4pc Deepwood Memories** on her if your teammates have better options for DPS and your team needs Dendro RES Shred. However, this is usually unlikely to happen, as most Dendro characters synergize with the set better than her.


## Team Building
*Authored by Dylan*

Some Recommended Teams:
### Mono Hydro
Candace - Xingqiu - Yelan/Anemo - Flex
One of the safer team compositions, since it allows characters with higher energy recharge requirements to build less ER. Xingqiu will likely be the character exploiting Candace’s Normal Attack infusion, since he will have a Hydro DMG bonus goblet. Yelan works nicely with this team, since she has good off-field damage and makes use of the new Hydro resonance. Sucrose and Kazuha work nicely as the Anemo flex, since they have crowd control and gives enemies Resistance Shred. Jean and Sayu also work well, if you think that Xingqiu’s healing is not enough.

![](/faq/candace/monohydro.png)

### Bloom Teams

Fridge 

Candace/Dendro/Cryo/Anemo 

Fridge is a playstyle where Cryo and Dendro coexist on a target, so applying Hydro will cause both Frozen and Bloom. It’s also important to note that Frozen enemies preserve a Dendro aura longer, so more Blooms occur. These teams focus on creating as many Blooms as you can, since Blooms will automatically detonate when there are more than five on field. 

Some recommended Cryo characters are Kaeya, Rosaria, and Diona (recommended for heals, though application isn’t the best). Both Rosaria and Kaeya would have better Cryo application, but having a healer is basically mandatory with Bloom. The Anemo flex can be Sucrose or Kazuha (Though you can use Jean or Sayu if you aren’t using Diona). Sucrose would buff the party with Elemental Mastery while providing crowd control. If you use Kazuha, you can use him as a driver since he will be the one with the most Elemental Mastery, and also providing better CC than Sucrose. Either Collei or DMC will work in the Dendro slot, as they can both apply Dendro off-field.

![](/faq/candace/fridge.png)

Nilou Bloom

Candace/Nilou/DMC/Dendro or Hydro

Candace's Hydro Infusion give DMC more Bloom ownership, allowing him to build more EM for higher Bloom damage. Candace can also proc some Bloom with her Constellation 6, thus she can also use EM artifacts as long as she can still Burst off cooldown. Nilou would want as much HP as possible to increase Bloom damage, while the Flex slot should be a healer to keep the team healthy.

![](/faq/candace/nilou.png)

Hyperbloom

Candace/Electro/Dendro/Flex

Hyperbloom focuses on building Elemental Mastery on the Hyperbloom trigger, to maximize the amount of damage dealt by Hyperbloom. Some recommended Flex characters are Anemo character like Kazuha, Sucrose, Jean, and Sayu, or Zhongli with his shield is also great. If you run Sucrose instead of any of the other recommended Anemo characters, DMC would be the one driving. Electro-Charged can also proc in this team, while also making Blooms.

### Vaporize

Xiangling/Candace/Bennett/Xingqiu

As a solo Hydro, Candace will not apply enough Hydro to where Xiangling can Vaporize every hit, so Xingqiu will be necessary in order to apply enough Hydro. Candace’s infusion also doesn’t last the entire Pyronado duration. Unfortunately you can’t use Viridescent Venerer with this team composition, but you get Hydro application and extra damage from Candace’s infusion instead.

![](/faq/candace/vaporize.png)
### Freeze

Candace/Cryo or Hydro/Cryo/Anemo 

Candace in freeze would allow Kaeya or Rosaria to drive to apply Hydro, while their Skills and Burst allow them to apply Cryo. A Hydro flex like Yelan or Xingqiu would increase the amount of Hydro application and do a good amount of off-field damage.  If you are using a Cryo flex, Diona works if you feel like you need healing and aren’t using Jean or Sayu as the Anemo character. Otherwise you can use both Kaeya and Rosaria for the Cryo slots.

## Constellation
*Authored by Atilla the Pun*

![artifact](/faq/candace/c1.png)
**C1 - Returning Heiress of the Scarlet Sands** 

Gives 3 more seconds of burst uptime and infusion. Doesn’t increase her damage, but increased uptime means more uptime on Hydro aura and her buff, allowing for greedier rotations, which is basically always a welcome addition. Rating 4/5s

![artifact](/faq/candace/c2.png)
**C2 - Moon-Piercing Brilliance** 

Gives 20% more HP to Candace, which results in ~7% more personal damage and an extra 1% on her NA buff. More stats is more stats, but it’s nothing to write home about. Rating 1/5

![artifact](/faq/candace/c3.png)
**C3 - Hunter's Supplication** 

Adds an extra 3 levels to her burst. However, this only adds a little damage for a character whose damage by and large does not matter, Rating 1/5

![artifact](/faq/candace/c4.png)
**C4 - Sentinel Oath**

Reduces hold CD to match tap CD so you no longer have rotations ruined by accidental perfect counters. Largely QOL, but a large QOL Rating 3/5

![artifact](/faq/candace/c5.png)
**C5 - Heterochromatic Gaze**

Adds an extra 3 levels to her skill. However, this only adds a little damage for a character whose damage by and large does not matter, Rating 1/5

![artifact](/faq/candace/c6.png)
**C6 - The Overflow**

C6 is an entire kit, almost doubling her damage while also bringing her up to 9-10 Hydro apps over 12s in addition to the normal infusion. This alone makes her damage actually notable, while also making her a very usable Hydro aura for characters that can work around her infusion, while also making her a good bloom proccer should we ever get the Dendro app to support it. Rating 5/5

While it is hard to specifically quantify how much better c6 than c0 is for a unit whose primary usage is for Hydro application, an extra 3 seconds of infusion in addition to 4-5 extra waves generally will translate to 6-7 more apps in a 15 second period. This is a very large amount of additional application and brings her from a niche unit with incredible energy issues to an invaluable addition to teams that cannot reconcile themselves with Xingqiu's long cooldowns.
