## Character Overview
*Authored by Dylan*

![](/faq/candace/Candace.png)

Candace is a Hydro polearm-user who is most comfortable being played as a support. She is the only character at the time of writing who offers a Hydro infusion to melee weapons. Aside from this, she is a character who scales entirely with HP, much like Nilou, unless you’re committing to auto-attacks (which is not recommended). 

Using Candace’s burst off cooldown is essential, so you must have 220% Energy Recharge as a solo Hydro (no Favonius Lance), and 200% if you are using Favonius Lance. If you are using Favonius Lance with another Hydro character, Candace’s energy requirements are lowered to 180%.

Candace cares about Energy Recharge, Crit Rate (at least 30%), HP, Crit Damage,  and sometimes ATK (if on-field DPS) or Elemental Mastery (if built for transformative reactions). As far as weapons go, you can pick any weapon that has Crit, HP, or Energy Recharge, since all of her talents scale off of HP (excluding auto-attacks).

Candace’s constellations focus on improving her personal damage, increasing application, and extending hydro infusion.Candace’s C1 extends the duration of her Hydro infusion, C2 will increase her max HP by 20% when her Elemental Skill hits an enemy. Her C6 gives her extra Hydro application and where most of her personal damage comes from, assuming she isn’t the one on field. 


## Talents
*Authored by Athena*

**Leveling priority: Burst > Skill > Normal Attack**

### Analysis:

Candace’s kit mainly involves around her Burst to enable her Hydro infusion, and since she scales almost entirely of HP aside from Normal Attacks, leveling her to 90 is recommended to max out her base HP. Keep in mind that her damage contribution is not the greatest, therefore investing in other important units is advisable here. 

Her Normal Attacks do not deal a great amount of damage, and it is also the only part of her kit to scale off ATK instead of HP, thus diverting her build (except for on-field Candace enthusiast, then level her Normal Attack first). 

Candace’s skill has two options, tap and hold. Both scale with max HP. On tap, she rushes forward and deals Hydro damage, while holding her skill blocks the incoming damage with a shield that scales off her HP, has a longer cooldown but deals more damage. While holding can inflict more damage, it is not recommended since it takes a long time to cast , and the damage difference is not worth the time. After Ascension 1, when you get hit while shielding, her skill will finish instantly (similar to Yun Jin’s skill) but still has the same cooldown as when holding. With her fourth Constellation, her hold cooldown is reduced to be the same as her tap cooldown, which allows for more hold skill use if get the right timing. 

Candace’s burst is her biggest selling point. Being the first character that provides Hydro infusion, she enables driver options for freeze, vaporize and bloom teams among others. Her Burst, combined with her Ascension 4 passive, will buff Elemental Normal Attacks hence also buff the on-field driver. When swapping between characters, it creates Wave Impact DMG instances that scales off HP, which is her main source of damage when playing as a support. 

Finally, her overworld passive talent is great for exploring with the 20% climbing stamina reduction. 


## ER Requirement
*Authored by Athena*

In general, Candace needs around 220% Energy Recharge (ER%) **with** Favonius Lance to burst every rotation as a solo hydro unit due to her Skill’s particle generation being lackluster for her 60-cost Burst, as well as she will most likely be off-field after using her Burst, making funneling energy particles difficult. Each favonius weapon passive proc will reduce her Energy Recharge requirement by 15% to 20%. In situations where her team comp has another hydro unit, her Energy Recharge requirement is significantly reduced to 180% **with** Favonius Lance. As always, an Energy Recharge Calculator is recommended to figure out how much ER% Candace needs in certain team comps. 


## Weapons
*Authored by Athena*

Due to her enormously high ER requirement before C6, the weapon options are quite limited here; some of them make 2pc Emblem/Exile mandatory on her, thus may reduce team’s damage without 4pc Viridescent Venerer effect. At C6, she can choose more offensive options to increase her personal damage without worrying too much about her energy problem

*For more explicit number and ranking, please check out the mastersheet*

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/wep1.png)
**Favonius Warbow**
- Arguably her Best-in-Slot 4* weapon; it lowers her ER requirement with the particles provided by its passive. Also allow her to use 4pc Viridescent Venerer without compromising the ER needed.

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/wep2.png)
**Elegy for the End**
- Also an amazing choice that both give ER% needed and team-wide buff. 

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/wep3.png)
**End of the Line**
- An acceptable F2P weapon that gives moderate ER% if Favonius Warbow has been occupied. 

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/wep4.png)
**Other ER weapons**
- They can be used if all the options above are not availnpm install -g npmable. 

**Offensive options**
- Only use them if you have Faruzan at Constellation 6, where her ER requirements are much more acceptable. All of them are pretty similar in strength therefore any option will do. 

## ARTIFACTS

***Artifact Main Stats***

Candace has two build options: On-field and Off-field. Depending on what purpose you choose, her builds will change in order to fit the corresponding playstyle.

**Off-field:**

**Sands of Eon: HP% or ER%**
ER% sand is always recommended to easily reach ER requirement. For situations where her ER requirement is lower, HP% sand can be considered to further buff the on-field character. 

**Goblet of Eonothem: Hydro DMG% or HP%**
Hydro DMG% let Candace deal more damage while HP% one boost the driver’s

**Circlet of Logos: CRIT or HP%**
Same as Goblet, CRIT for more personal damage and HP% to enhance on-field driver Normal Attacks damage.

> Substats priority: ER% (until meet requirement) > CR > CD > HP% = EM


**On-field Hydro DPS build: **

**Sands of Eon: ATK% or ER%**
ER% sand is always recommended to easily reach ER requirement. For situations where her ER requirement is lower, ATK% will increase her Normal Attack damage. 

**Goblet of Eonothem: Hydro DMG%**
Hydro DMG% let Candace deal more damage through her Normal Attacks

**Circlet of Logos: CRIT**
Same as Goblet, CRIT let her dish out more damage overall.

> Substats priority: ER% (until meet requirement) > CR = CD > ATK% > HP% > EM


**On-field**


For on-field Hydro DPS Candace, her artifacts choices are quite flexible. Usually you would aim for **4pc Heart of Depths** or **4pc Gladiator’s Finale**, but a combination of **2pc ATK%** (*Gladiator’s Finale*, *Shimenawa’s Reminiscence* ,...), **2pc Tenacity of the Milleliths**, **2pc Heart of Depths**, **2pc Emblem of Severed Fate** with better substats than the 4pc options above should also perform very similarly. 

**Off-field**


For off-field support, Candace has two main choices: **4pc Noblesse Oblige** (NO) and **4pc Instructor** to buff teammates after using burst. Using 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate or combining 2pc sets can achieve higher damage, however it lacks the utility provided by the two mentioned above. In certain 15-second rotation, **4pc Exile** can also be worth using to lessen other characters’ Energy Recharge, making it useful to invest the substats leaning more toward damage (Note that in **4pc Instructor** and **4pc Exile** case, a 5 stars ER Sands is **very** recommended for more Energy Recharge on Candace to meet her Energy Recharge requirement).

You can also consider **4pc Deepwood Memories** on her if your teammates have better options for DPS and your team needs Dendro RES Shred. However, this is usually unlikely to happen, as most Dendro characters synergize with the set better than her.

**Off-field Burst DPS**

![]
For off-field Burst DPS, Candace has two main choices: **4pc Emblem of Severed Fate** (EoSF) and **4pc Noblesse Oblige** (NO). For 4pc EoSF, combining with an ER% weapon can increase her burst and C6 damage; while 4pc NO is generally used for buffing other teammates. The other 2pc options can be viable with good substats, but in most cases it is not recommended.

**Off-field Support**


For off-field support, Candace has two main choices: **4pc Noblesse Oblige** (NO) and **4pc Instructor** to buff teammates after using burst. Using 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate or combining 2pc sets can achieve higher damage, however it lacks the utility provided by the two mentioned above.

You can also consider **4pc Deepwood Memories** on her if your teammates have better options for DPS and your team needs Dendro RES Shred. However, this is usually unlikely to happen, as most Dendro characters synergize with the set better than her.


### Options

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/arti5.png)
**4PC Tenacity of the Millelith** - Only viable when Faruzan is at C6 due to its extra Collapse being able to maintain the ATK% Buff throughout the entire Anemo DPS on-field time. 



## Team Building
*Authored by Athena*

Her kit excels at giving buffs to Anemo characters and Anemo RES Shred to the enemies, therefore she should be paired with some of the Anemo main carries that are available at the moment. 

![](/faq/faruzan/team.png)

**Hypercarry Anemo:**

Wanderer / Xiao / Heizou - Faruzan - Bennett/Flex - Flex

Pairing anyone of those 3 above with Faruzan is essential to bring out their maximum potential. The last 2 slots can be anyone that either brings more to the team or the main carry: *Bennett*, *Zhongli*, *Yelan*, *Fischl*, … Do note that in teams that have a sub DPS like *Yelan* or *Xingqiu*, pairing her with 4pc Viridescent Venerer should be prioritized to enhance their damage.

**Overall Anemo support**

As an Anemo character, she has access to 4pc Viridescent Venerer, which is useful overall. Therefore, she can technically fit in as the flex slot just for the 4VV effect and ignore her energy problem by not Bursting every rotation. However, she is not recommended because there exist other Anemo characters that either have more utilities or deal more damage than her.



## Constellation
*Authored by Chaos*

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/c1.png)
**C1 - Truth By Any Means** 
Gives her the ability to fire two Hurricane Arrows when you use fully charged aimed shots, but only after you use her Skill, *Wind Realm of Nasamjnin*. Normally, you do not want to fire both of them twice due to energy ICD, which will not generate another instance of Energy with the second consecutive second shot; rather than that, the second Arrow should only be used when you miss the first shot. Rating: 1/5 

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/c2.png)
**C2 - Overzealous Intellect** 
The polyhedron that is created during her burst stays for 6 seconds more on the field. A moderate constellation which can extend the rotation to around 22 seconds without losing its uptime. Rating: 2/5

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/c3.png)
**C3 - Spirit Orchard Stroll** 
Adds 3 more levels to her E skill. A minuscule damage buff, become better with her Constellation 6. Rating: 1/5

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/c4.png)
**C4 - Divine Comprehension**
The vortex that is created by pressurized collapse gives her energy particles based on how many opponents it hits, minimum of 2 energy and 0.5 per extra enemy, up to 4. This Constellation alone does not solve her energy problem, but combined with C6 will. Rating: 2/5

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/c5.png)
**C5 - Wonderland of Rumination**
Adds 3 more levels to her burst. Increase both the main Anemo carry and her own damage. Rating: 2.5/5

![artifact](/faq/faruzan/c6.png)
**C6 - The Wondrous Path of Truth**
Characters that are in her burst’s field and obtain the Prayerful Wind’s Benefit will have their crit damage increase by 40% if they happen to deal Anemo damage, while also apply Pressurized Collapsed to the enemy. Not only does it improve the main Anemo carry damage, it also lowers both of their energy issues by triggering Pressurized Collapsed that deals more damage from C3, restore energies to Faruzan with C4 and generate Anemo particles overtime.  Rating: 6/5
