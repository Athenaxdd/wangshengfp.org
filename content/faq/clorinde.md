_Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions. Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt._

-   Hey everyone, the WFP TC team would like to present our Clorinde FAQ and Mastersheet! This time around we are leveraging our [wfpsim tool](wfpsim.com) to handle a majority of our calculations instead of the traditional spreadsheets. This is a new process for us but should hopefully improve the quality of our content.

-   Like how we did things in the past, WFP staff (mainly KB) will be around to answer any questions in the comments.

## Character Overview

_Authored by Leifa_

![](/faq/clorinde/Clorinde.png)

Clorinde is a 5-star Electro Sword character aligned with Ousia whose kit revolves around building up Bond of Life with her Normal Attacks to unleash fast lunges with her Skill. Her Elemental Skill causes her to enter the "Night Vigil" state, replacing her Normal Attacks with ranged pistolet attacks, as well as replacing her Skill with a lunging attack, dealing Electro DMG. During the "Night Vigil" state, Clorinde's attacks can pierce enemies, allowing her to hit multiple enemies at once.

Clorinde is played on-field, providing both damage and large amounts of Electro application for the team. Due to having fast, ranged Normal Attacks, she has strong innate synergy with current off-field characters, such as Fischl and Xingqiu.

## WFP Subjective Analysis

_Authored by KB_

Clorinde’s kit puts a high emphasis on the value of mobility, utility, and healing instead of focusing on damage. The easiest way to conceptualize her power budget is imagining if Alhaitham did ~30% less damage, but in exchange got the ability to self-heal, dash around with no stamina cost, and retained his larger than usual AoE for a melee unit. For most players this is a pretty good package for a unit, considering that if a unit like Arlecchino wanted to tech into defensive options, they would have to give up a valuable team slot.

It can’t be understated how smooth of a driver she is for other sub DPS units. Her mobility isn’t quite like Neuvillette where he can freely glide, but it comes pretty darn close once you get used to how her skill works (for the love of god learn that her lunge can be controlled with movement inputs). Her AoE is surprisingly decent for a melee character and if you play her with Furina **you will not die ever**.

There will be players that will be disappointed with her personal damage, especially considering Arlecchino was released right before her. Which is fine, Arlecchino and Clorinde are targeting different kinds of players. People who praise Arlecchino generally are okay with things such as no external healing if it means they can do high amounts of front-loaded damage. They are fine with building a team around giga-boosting a unit’s performance. Clorinde, on the other hand, feels like the polar opposite. She wants her allies to contribute damage. Her damage profile is more sustained instead of bursty, and of course she does less damage than a selfish unit. After all, it wouldn’t be fair for her to do **everything** well (looking at you Neuv).

## Clorinde vs Alhaitham Banner

We recommend Alhaitham slightly more for most players.

To keep it short, if you already have a defensive unit like Kuki, Kirara, Xingqiu, Baizhu, or even Yaoyao, Alhaitham becomes a very comfortable unit to use while maintaining good damage. Alhaitham also has the option to push for higher damage at C0 with a full offensive team at the cost of comfort.

In general Alhaitham teams have more damage than Clorinde at the C0 level. Clorinde does have significantly better constellations which allows her to close the gap. If you don’t have many defensive options Clorinde could be much easier to play than Alhaitham. At the end of the day both units are quite good so it’s not a big deal if you prefer one over the other.

## Talents

_Authored by June_

### Leveling Priority

-   Skill > Burst
-   Level 90 is beneficial since she is triggering incidental Hyperblooms or Aggravate

![](/faq/clorinde/talent.png)

### Analysis

-   Clorinde’s Electro-infused Normal Attacks, which are her main source of damage, scale from her Elemental Skill Talent and not her Normal Attack Talent, therefore it is recommended to prioritize leveling her Skill. There is no need to level her Normal Attack Talent.
-   It is also recommended to level her Burst after her Skill, not only for additional damage, but also due to the Bond of Life Clorinde grants herself scaling with the Burst Talent level.

#### Normal Attack: Oath of Hunting Shadows

![](/faq/clorinde/normal.png)
Clorinde’s regular Normal Attacks are nothing special to look at. Instead, Clorinde’s Electro-infused pistolet attacks during her special state on her Skill are her main source of damage and will be further discussed in the Elemental Skill section.

#### Elemental Skill: Hunter's Vigil

![](/faq/clorinde/skill.png)

> Clorinde enters a special state called Night Vigil state. In this state, her Normal Attacks become Electro-infused pistolet attacks and her Skill becomes a lunging attack that is considered as Normal Attack DMG. Clorinde summons a single Ousia blade along with her infused Normal Attacks. During this state, Clorinde does not receive healing from external sources, instead the external healing is converted to Bond of Life. The percentage of healing that converts to her Bond of Life is 80%. This state lasts for 7.5s and automatically ends when Clorinde leaves the field.

Clorinde gains different effects depending on her Bond of Life value when performing the infused Normal Attacks and lunging attack. Upon using her infused Normal Attacks, if her Bond of Life value is less than 100% of her Max HP, her infused Normal Attacks deal increased damage,pierce through enemies, and grant Clorinde a 35% BoL. Otherwise, when her Bond of Life value is equal to or greater than 100%, she just performs her weaker infused Normal Attacks.

Upon using her lunging attack, if she has a Bond of Life less than 100% of her Max HP, Clorinde is healed based on her Bond of Life value, while her lunging attack gains an AoE and DMG increase. If her Bond of Life value is equal to or greater than 100%, the healing she gains and her lunging attack’s AoE and DMG is increased even further. Otherwise, when she has no Bond of Life value, she just performs her lunging attack.

It is recommended to always use her lunging attack whenever she has at least 100% in Bond of Life value. Your total health bar represents 200% Bond of Life, so this 100% would be at the halfway point.

#### Elemental Burst: Last Lightfall

![](/faq/clorinde/burst.png)
Clorinde’s Burst is fairly straightforward. It is an AoE multi-hit attack that hits 5 times and also grants herself a large amount of Bond of Life based on her Burst Talent level. At Talent Level 7+, it grants enough Bond of Life to use her strongest lunging attack immediately.

#### A1 Passive: Dark-Shattering Flame

![](/faq/clorinde/a1.png)

> When a party member triggers an Electro reaction, Clorinde’s infused Normal Attacks and Burst gain an Additive DMG Bonus based on 20% of her ATK. This Additive DMG Bonus caps at 1800, stacks up 3 times and lasts 15s, with each stack having an independent duration.

This means that any ATK above 3000 will not increase her damage significantly, since this Passive accounts for roughly half of her non-reaction damage.

#### A4 Passive: Lawful Remuneration

![](/faq/clorinde/a4.png)

> Clorinde gains 10% CRIT Rate for 15s after each fully-enhanced lunging attack, stacking up to 2 times, with each stack’s duration being independent from each other. Clorinde’s healing conversion to Bond of Life during her Night Vigil state increases as well, from 80% to 100% conversion.

This passive can make it difficult to fit in a CRIT Rate weapon without overcapping since she also gains CRIT from her ascension levels.

#### Utility Passive: Night Vigil's Harvest

![](/faq/clorinde/passive.png)

> Clorinde’s Utility Passive displays the location of Fontaine’s local specialties on the mini-map, aiding in material farming for Fontaine characters.

## Constellation

_Authored by June and KB_

### Overview

On paper, many of Clorinde’s core Constellations (C1/C2/C4/C6) are actually pretty substantial increases to her damage. However, C0 Clorinde does not have the same ceiling of damage as her DPS peers such as Arlecchino, Neuvillette, or Alhaitham. In addition, one of her strongest teams usually involves her doing a smaller share of the team’s total DPS. This ends up diminishing the gains from her Constellations compared to getting upgrades on a different DPS unit such as Arlecchino, who owns the lion's share of her team’s total DPS. This is our reasoning for the lower scores on the Constellations since we believe Clorinde’s value is already built into C0 and is more about her utility, mobility, and self-sustain, rather than her personal damage.

For players more interested in playing Aggravate or even Hypercarry Clorinde teams, these Constellations will be more influential than our listed ratings.

Sims done with R1 Absolution in a Fischl Sucrose Kirara team. Please check the [WFP Clorinde Mastersheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12uZ1moj3NEJXZo6MIf_jTVJ5Q-SM58y2FrO4K9SDAo0/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

### Constellation 1 - "From This Day, I Pass the Candle's Shadow-Veil"

![](/faq/clorinde/c1.png)

_While Hunter's Vigil's Night Vigil state is active, when Electro DMG from Clorinde's Normal Attacks hit opponents, they will trigger 2 coordinated attacks from a Nightvigil Shade summoned near the hit opponent, each dealing 30% of Clorinde's ATK as Electro DMG._
_This effect can occur once every 1.2s. DMG dealt this way is considered Normal Attack DMG._

Clorinde gains some additional damage during her infused Normal Attacks through her summon’s coordinated attacks.

**DPS% Increase vs. C0**: 25.5%

**Rating**: 3/5

### Constellation 2 - "Now, As We Face the Perils of the Long Night"

![](/faq/clorinde/c2.png)
_Enhance the Passive Talent "Dark-Shattering Flame": After a nearby party member triggers a Electro-related reaction against an opponent, Electro DMG dealt by Clorinde's Normal Attacks and Last Lightfall will be increased by 30% of Clorinde's ATK for 15s. Max 3 stacks. Each stack is counted independently. When you have 3 stacks, Clorinde's interruption resistance will be increased. The Maximum DMG increase achievable this way for the above attacks is 2,700._

_You must first unlock the Passive Talent "Dark-Shattering Flame."_

The Additive DMG Bonus from Clorinde’s A1 Passive and its cap is increased, further boosting Clorinde’s damage output. The absolute damage gain from C1 to C2 is the same as going from C0 to C1. You can think of C2 as getting C1 again, but with a bonus of interruption resistance. The interruption resistance granted from C2 is the same as Xingqiu’s orbital Rain Swords.

**DPS% Increase vs. C1**: 18.0%

**DPS% Increase vs. C0**: 48.1%

**Rating**: 3/5

### Constellation 3 - "I Pledge to Remember the Oath of Daylight"

![](/faq/clorinde/c3.png)
_Increases the Level of Hunter's Vigil by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

An increase in Clorinde's Elemental Skill level. Unfortunately, a large portion of her damage also comes from her A1 Passive, so this increase is less than a typical C3.

**DPS% Increase vs. C2**: 4.6%

**DPS% Increase vs. C0**: 54.8%

**Rating**: 0/5

### Constellation 4 - "To Enshrine Tears, Life, and Love"

![](/faq/clorinde/c4.png)
_When Last Lightfall deals DMG to opponent(s), DMG dealt is increased based on Clorinde's Bond of Life percentage. Every 1% of her current Bond of Life will increase Last Lightfall DMG by 2%. The maximum Last Lightfall DMG increase achievable this way is 200%._

Although this Constellation doesn’t seem like a large upgrade on sheets/sims, it does open the option to frontload her damage for quickly clearing a wave. At this level she has the option to go for one-shot nuke builds although our recommendation is still leaning towards Quickbloom teams due to how versatile they are.

**DPS% Increase vs. C3**: 9.9%

**DPS% Increase vs. C0**: 70.1%

**Rating**: 3/5

### Constellation 5 - "Holding Dawn's Coming as My Votive"

![](/faq/clorinde/c5.png)

_Increases the Level of Last Lightfall by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

Yeah, this is really only a stepping stone to get to C6. Never go for C5 only.

**DPS% Increase vs. C4**: 2.1%

**DPS% Increase vs. C0**: 73.7%

**Rating**: 0/5

### Constellation 6 - "And So Shall I Never Despair"

![](/faq/clorinde/c6.png)

_For 12s after Hunter's Vigil is used, Clorinde's CRIT Rate will be increased by 10%, and her CRIT DMG by 70%._ > _Additionally, while Night Vigil is active, a Glimbright Shade will appear under specific circumstances, attacking opponents and dealing 200% of Clorinde's ATK as Electro DMG. DMG dealt this way is considered Normal Attack DMG._ > _The Glimbright Shade will appear under the following circumstances:_

-   _When Clorinde is about to be attacked by an opponent._
-   _When Clorinde uses Impale the Night: Pact._

_1 Glimbright Shade can be summoned in the aforementioned ways every 1s. 6 Shades can be summoned per single Night Vigil duration._
_In addition, while Night Vigil is active, the DMG Clorinde receives is decreased by 80% and her interruption resistance is increased. This effect will disappear after the Night Vigil state ends or 1s after she summons 6 Glimbright Shades._

Here we go, Clorinde is now a mobile, utility, self healing driver that **also** does an absurd amount of damage. In addition, Clorinde at C6 is impossible to kill with how much damage reduction and healing she has. This Constellation really does ascend her to a DPS unit that does almost everything well.

**DPS% Increase vs. C5**: 41.7%

**DPS% Increase vs. C0**: 146.1%

**Rating**: 4/5

## Energy Recharge Requirements

_Authored by KB_

Clorinde does not really need to build ER since bursting isn’t that much of a DPS gain. You should still Burst when it is up of course, but it is usually not worth building ER over more CRIT. The one exception is C4+ Clorinde, which at that point it is important to calculate your specific ER needs with the tools below.

Clorinde’s ER requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).

## Artifacts

_Authored by KB_

### Artifact Stats

**Sands of Eon**: ATK% / EM

**Goblet of Eonothem**: Electro DMG%

**Circlet of Logos**: CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG

**Substats** : CRIT > ATK% > EM/ER

At C0, ATK% and EM sands perform about the same if Clorinde is triggering Hyperbloom. Without Hyperbloom ATK% sands is slightly preferable. Any Constellation above C0 will prefer ATK% sands over EM.

### Artifact Sets

![](/faq/clorinde/whimsy.png)
**4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy**

Generally Clorinde’s highest personal damage set, especially at higher Constellations.

**4pc Thundering Fury**
![](/faq/clorinde/tf.png)
This set is used when shortening Clorinde’s cooldowns is more beneficial than increasing her personal damage. An example of an ideal 4pc TF team is Clorinde-Furina-Nahida-Fischl, where Nahida and Furina have long-lasting deployable Skills/Bursts. Clorinde can swap off once to refresh Oz and then go back to being on-field. 4pc TF is not recommended for pure Electro-Charged teams.

**4pc Gladiator's Finale**
![](/faq/clorinde/glad.png)
A fine budget option to use before farming for 4pc FHW. Roughly 10% less personal damage compared to FHW which is not too bad considering Quickbloom teams do not need her to do outstanding damage.

## Weapons

_Authored by KB_

\*Sims are done for both 4pc TF Quickbloom and 4pc FOHW Aggravate teams. Please read the [WFP Clorinde Mastersheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12uZ1moj3NEJXZo6MIf_jTVJ5Q-SM58y2FrO4K9SDAo0/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

**Absolution**
![](/faq/clorinde/absolution.png)
Her signature and best weapon. It is a significant personal damage increase that is comparable to her C1.

**Light of Foliar Incision**
![](/faq/clorinde/lofi.png)
On the same launch banner as her signature weapon. It is actually the 2nd best option for her so it’s pretty hard to be upset about losing in the banner. Foliar is also a bit more versatile than her signature which is nice if you have multiple sword DPS units.

**The Black Sword**
![](/faq/clorinde/blacksword.png)
Despite having a healing Passive which works with her BoL generation, the main reason this weapon is good on her is that it’s a good statstick that also grants high Normal Attack DMG%. At R1 it performs as well as Finale of the Deep R5. Once refined to R5 it starts creeping close to Foiliar’s DPS.

**Finale of the Deep**
![](/faq/clorinde/finale.png)
Clorinde is the perfect user of this weapon, since the passive gives her a massive amount of ATK. While this weapon does not trump many of the 5-star swords it gets pretty darn close, which is very impressive considering it is **craftable**! Most people will be perfectly satisfied with sitting on this weapon instead of going for upgrades. If you are worried about missing out on damage, please look at the [WFP Clorinde Mastersheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12uZ1moj3NEJXZo6MIf_jTVJ5Q-SM58y2FrO4K9SDAo0/edit?usp=sharing) for her weapon calcs to see how much of a difference in **team DPS** it is to sit on a free weapon; it is surprisingly low for a 5-star unit.

## Teambuilding

_Authored by KB_

### Furina

![](/faq/clorinde/furina.png)
Furina has a pretty nice interaction with how Clorinde heals from her Skill. Healing Bonus applies to the huge 110% Max HP healing from her lunging attacks before the Bond of Life reduces the healing. This means that even having only 150 Fanfare stacks on Furina will make Clorinde heal more than double her normal amount. For players with access to C1/C2 Furina, they can increase the healing to roughly half of Clorinde’s Max HP!

<!-- |                  | Healing Bonus\* | Amount of Max HP Healed\* |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Base             | 0%              | 10.50%                    |
| 150 Fanfare      | 14%             | 26.09%                    |
| 300 Fanfare      | 27%             | 41.69%                    |
| 400 Fanfare (C1) | 36%             | 52.08%                    | -->

\*Furina Talent Level 9 Burst

#### Furina Quickbloom (Meta)

![](/faq/clorinde/quickbloom.png)

4pc Thundering Fury Recommended

**Clorinde | Furina | Dendro | Dendro/Electro**

Ideal Setup

**Clorinde | Furina | Nahida | Fischl**

Generally considered her strongest team archetype. Furina is one of the most important units for Clorinde teams due to how well she interacts with Clorinde’s healing in addition to buffing several sub DPS units. Clorinde’s mobility is also unrestricted in this team with Oz’s range being the only real concern for positioning.

**Teammates:**

Dendro Options:

-   **Nahida:** One of the best Dendro options for Clorinde since she is able to provide a hefty EM buff while maintaining a strong Dendro aura off-field.

-   **Dendro Traveler (DMC):** A fine budget option if Nahida is not available. DMC is able to provide sufficient off-field Dendro but with lower uptime compared to Nahida.

-   **Baizhu:** Grants decent interruption resistance to deal with more troublesome enemies. His Dendro application is very single-target compared to the other options. Can be used as the sole Dendro applier in single-target content. Otherwise in AoE, it’s recommended to pair another Dendro unit with him.

Electro Options:

-   **Fischl:** A very strong option for this archetype. Fischl’s cooldowns line up pretty well with 4pc TF Clorinde and allow for short rotations. Her damage contribution at C6 is close to the same as C0 Clorinde in this team when Clorinde is using 4TF.

-   **Yae Miko:** Not as strong of an option as Fischl but still serviceable. It is recommended to use 4pc FHW on Clorinde when playing with Yae since the rotation length is longer. Both Yae and Clorinde do not need to worry about building ER since their Bursts are minor in DPS gains.

-   **Beidou:** Not recommended in single-target, but is a good option when fighting multiple enemies. Her interruption resistance is much appreciated by Clorinde and the additional damage reduction will make her close to immortal. Clorinde’s pistol and lunge attacks both proc Beidou’s Burst effectively, making her a decent driver.

### Aggravate (Meta)

![](/faq/clorinde/agg.png)

**Clorinde | Electro | Dendro| Flex**

Ideal Setup

**Clorinde | Fischl | Kirara/Nahida | Kazuha/Sucrose**

Clorinde’s Skill has fantastic synergy with Fischl in Aggravate teams since her application and attack rate are faster than most Electro characters. Clorinde’s Aggravate teams are similar to Keqing’s Aggravate except Clorinde brings much more mobility and has self-healing. Usually other Aggravate teams have to sacrifice a decent amount of damage or grouping for survivability since the defensive options are not great (Kuki/Kirara/Jean).

**Teammates:**

Electro Options:

-   **Fischl:** One of the most important units for this archetype. Like the Quickbloom teams, Fischl also contributes a significant amount of damage in Aggravate as well.

-   **Yae Miko:** Not as strong of an option as Fischl but still serviceable. It is recommended to use 4pc FHW on Clorinde when playing with Yae since the rotation length is longer. Both Yae and Clorinde do not need to worry about building ER since their Bursts are minor in DPS gains.

Dendro Options:

-   **Nahida:** Offers the highest amount of team DPS compared to any other Dendro unit. Be aware that swirling Electro with Nahida requires careful planning since she applies so much Dendro.

-   **Kirara:** She offers less damage than Nahida but in exchange grants Clorinde interruption resistance and makes Swirling Electro much easier.

-   **Baizhu:** Fills a similar role as Kirara although with more issues. His Burst cooldown is too long for shorter rotations and the shield from Kiara is much better at granting interruption resistance. His Dendro application also suffers in AoE.

-   **Dendro Traveler:** Offers a pretty easy-to-access Dendro application for players that can’t use Nahida.

Flex Options:

-   **Sucrose:** Used for VV and her EM buff for allies.

-   **Kazuha:** Similar to Sucrose but also allows for better grouping.

-   **Zhongli:** Provides easy RES Shred to both Electro and Dendro. The interruption resistance provided by his shield makes Clorinde easy to play. Only loses about 10% team DPS compared to the options above.

-   **Beidou:** Can be a decent option vs 2+ targets while also granting damage reduction and interruption resistance.

### Taser

![](/faq/clorinde/taser.png)

**Clorinde | Electro| Hydro | Anemo/Hydro**

Ideal Setup

**Clorinde | Furina | Yelan/Fischl | Kazuha**

Although Clorinde is the first “good” Electro Taser driver character to come out, her Quickbloom and Aggravate teams usually utilizes her kit better. That being said, her function as a Taser unit is perfectly fine and the Hydro units that can pair with her are rather strong (Xingqiu/Yelan/Furina).

**Teammates:**

Hydro Options:

-   **Xingqiu/Yelan:** Function pretty similarly with Xingqiu being better defensively and Yelan offering more damage. They tend to prefer pairing up with a 2nd Hydro unit to reduce Energy costs.

-   **Furina:** Makes Clorinde much more durable while being able to buff all DPS characters in the party.

Electro Options:

-   **Fischl:** A classic unit for Taser teams, always try to deploy Oz in between Clorinde’s gaps of field time.

-   **Beidou:** Good in 2+ target situations and provides interruption resistance and damage reduction.

Anemo Options:

-   **Kazuha:** Provides grouping and buffs.

-   **Sucrose:** Similar to Kazuha but with weaker grouping and smaller buffs.

-   **Jean/Sayu:** Can be used in Furina teams for faster Fanfare generation.

### Hypercarry / Overload Clorinde (Not Recommended)

![](/faq/clorinde/hyper.png)

**Clorinde | Buffer | Buffer | Buffer or Anemo if no Chevreuse**

_Ideal Setup (For higher invest players only)_

**Clorinde | Sara | Chevreuse | Xiangling**

This playstyle only really makes sense for people who are at least C2R1 on Clorinde since at her C0 base she is not doing enough personal damage even with buffers to shine. Even at this level of investment the other teams above generally perform better and have even higher ceilings for upgrades such as using C2 Nahida or Furina.

**Teammates :**

Buffer Options:

-   **Sara C6:** Is able to buff Clorinde while not restricting her to a circle.

-   **Kazuha:** Offers grouping and Elemental DMG Bonus%.

-   **Chevreuse C6:** One of the few options for Electro and Pyro RES Shred that is not locked to Anemo units. Does have the restriction of forcing your whole team to be Pyro/Electro.

-   **Bennett:** His ATK buff can cap out Clorinde’s A1 Passive which is not ideal. A larger problem is that he forces Clorinde, a hyper-mobile character, to be constrained to a circle. His healing also does not really work with her since Clorinde’s self-healing usually keeps her healthy, so you can’t cheese out N2E’s with him.

Flex Options:

-   **Xiangling:** Mainly only used with Chevreuse variants.

-   **Thoma:** Decent for interruption resistance and can slot into Chevreuse teams.
