Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions. Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.

## **Character Overview**
*Authored by NatC*

Kirara is a 4-star Dendro Sword shielder, providing shields via her Skill and a tiny bit of extra damage from her Burst. That being said, it is not recommended to build Kirara for damage in spite of her decently high multipliers on her Burst due to her lack of access to amplifying reactions that take advantage of said multipliers, as well as the loss in shield strength.

What’s worth noting is that Kirara’s shield has extra absorption against Dendro DMG. This means that she could be an interesting slot-in in Bloom / Burgeon teams if one wishes to take advantage of the increased absorption. If not, she can very easily be slotted into quickswap teams due to her low cooldown on her Tap Skill.

## **Talents**

*Authored by NatC*

**Leveling Priority:** Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst

![](/static\faq\kirara\skillorder.png)

Since Kirara’s shields and a portion of her damage scale off of HP, having high levels on her is nice for primarily more shield absorption, with the added damage being the icing on the cake. Leveling her to 90 is preferred, but is by no means necessary to take full advantage of her kit. 

**Normal Attack: Boxcutter**

Kirara has attack multipliers that are similar to Shinobu’s throughout her Normal Attack sequence. Unfortunately, with abysmally low base attack and no other added gimmicks to it, there is little to no reason to make use of her attack string unless you specifically wish to build her to do so.

**Elemental Skill: Meow-teor Kick**

There are two variations to Kirara’s Skill — a pressed and a held version. Her Tap Skill initiates a **Tail-Flicking Flying Kick**, dealing AoE Dendro DMG while briefly applying Dendro to herself. It will also create a **Shield of Safe Transport** that lasts for 12s, the duration of which will be refreshed if a new shield is applied on top of it.

Her Hold Skill deploys a shield similar to the one that is created from her pressed Skill. On top of this, Kirara will curl up into a box, dealing damage to enemies she crashes into in a fashion similar to Sayu’s Skill. At the end of her Skill, she will unleash a **Flipclaw Strike**, dealing AoE Dendro DMG. The longer her Skill is held, the longer its cooldown will be at the end.

It’s worth noting that in her Hold Skill state, Kirara’s movement and climbing speed will be increased, making it possible for her to traverse climbable terrain more quickly in her box state at the cost of increased stamina consumption.

Kirara’s shields also have increased Dendro absorption, meaning that she could be an option for certain Bloom-based teams.

**Elemental Burst: Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch**

Kirara smashes enemies with a Special Delivery Package, dealing a large chunk of AoE Dendro DMG to enemies. After the explosion, the package will split up into a total of 6 Cat Grass Cardamoms, little bomblets similar to Klee’s. When enemies come into contact with said bomblets OR if left alone for 12 seconds, they will explode, dealing AoE Dendro DMG to enemies surrounding them. A nice bit of extra damage along with Dendro application, though her primary utility as a shieldbot means that the damage might not be as impactful as the numbers imply.

**Ascension 1 Passive: Bewitching, Betwitching Tails**

During Kirara’s held Skill state, crashing into enemies grants her a stack of Reinforced Packaging obtainable every 0.5s, up to a maximum of 3 stacks. When her held Skill ends, each stack of Reinforced Packaging will grant Kirara a Shield of Safe Transport, refreshing the duration of her shield and stacking on top of her existing shield up to the maximum that her Skill will allow. A very nice passive that helps with both Kirara’s shield strength and uptime.

**Ascension 4 Passive: Pupillary Variance**

Increases the damage from Kirara’s Skill and Burst, scaling with her maximum HP. Helps ever so slightly with Kirara’s damage when building her as a shieldbot, but nothing to write home about.

**Utility Passive: Cat's Creeping Carriage**

Prevents wild animals that produce meat when killed from getting startled when characters in the same active party as Kirara approach them. Helps when gathering ingredients for food, although do note that this will only work for the first enemy in the vicinity.

## Constellations

![](/static/faq/kirara/c1.png)
### Constellation 1 - Material Circulation

- Every 8,000 Max HP Kirara possesses will cause her to create 1 extra Cat Grass Cardamom when she uses Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch. A maximum of 4 extra can be created this way.

Gives Kirara the ability to create up to 4 extra bomblets depending on her Max HP, which is very likely if you were to build her as a shieldbot. A nice bit of extra Dendro application which could situationally be useful, although her damage is still nothing special.

***Rating:*** 1/5

![](/static/faq/kirara/c2.png)

### **Constellation 2 - Perfectly Packaged**

- When Kirara is in the Urgent Neko Parcel state of Meow-teor Kick, she will grant other party members she crashes into Critical Transport Shields.

- The DMG absorption of Critical Transport Shield is 40% of the maximum absorption Meow-teor Kick's normal Shields of Safe Transport are capable of, and will absorb Dendro DMG with 250% effectiveness.

- Critical Transport Shields last 12s and can be triggered once on each character every 10s.

A Constellation that is nice in co-op, granting mini-shields to allies who Kirara collides with. That being said, these shields can only be created in co-op, rendering this Constellation worthless in normal play.

***Rating:*** 3/5

![](/static/faq/kirara/c3.png)

### **Constellation 3 - Universal Recognition**

- Increases the Level of Meow-teor Kick by 3.

Three extra levels to Kirara’s Skill means that she has stronger shields and slightly more damage from her Skill. A solid Constellation for Kirara.

***Rating:*** 2/5

![](/static/faq/kirara/c4.png)

### **Constellation 4 - Steed of Skanda**

- After active character(s) protected by Shields of Safe Transport or Critical Transport Shields hit opponents with Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks, Kirara will perform a coordinated attack with them using Small Cat Grass Cardamoms, dealing 200% of her ATK as Dendro DMG.

- DMG dealt this way is considered Elemental Burst DMG. This effect can be triggered once every 3.8s. This CD is shared between all party members.

This Constellation is an interesting one. If your active character is protected by any of Kirara’s shields, their Normal / Charged / Plunging Attacks will trigger a coordinated attack, dealing Dendro DMG that scales off of Kirara’s Attack. This effect can be triggered a maximum of once every 3.8 seconds, and its CD is shared between all party members, meaning that it can only be triggered every 3.8 seconds as well in co-op.

Sadly, due to Kirara preferring to be built as a shieldbot, the damage from this is very meagre, and will not contribute a lot. That being said, this gives her off-field Dendro application similar to Collei’s, and theoretically opens up the possibility of running her off-field in Hyperbloom teams.

***Rating:*** 2/5

### **Constellation 5 - A Thousand Miles in a Day**

- Increases the Level of Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch by 3.

Increases Kirara’s Burst Talent level by 3, giving her more damage on her Burst and the subsequent bomblets. Again, not a particularly good Constellation by merit of Kirara preferring to build HP instead of damage.

***Rating:*** 1/5

![](/static/faq/kirara/c6.png)

### **Constellation 6 - Countless Sights to See**

- All nearby party members will gain 12% All Elemental DMG Bonus within 15s after Kirara uses her Elemental Skill or Burst.

Provides a nice bit of Elemental DMG Bonus for 15 seconds after Kirara uses her Skill and/or Burst, enabling the party to do more damage all-around.

A solid Constellation, with its main downside being locked behind Constellation 6.

***Rating:*** 2/5
